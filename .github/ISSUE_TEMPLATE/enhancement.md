name: Feature request
about: Suggest new things to be implemented in the package
---

## Target functionality

> Write a (pseudo)code example that you would like to work. If there is a
> dataset that you want to load in a new way (e.g., parse out new data from
> `libsbml`), include a link to the dataset.

## Desired output

> Suggest what would be the optimal output of the above "target" command for
> you, or how the newly loaded data should be represented by SBML.jl.

## Optional: Suggestions for implementation

> Feel free to point out a viable way to add the functionality, including
> pointers to required API functions and ideas about new data structures.
> If you have a code that implements the feature (at least partially), you may
> want to open a pull request instead.
